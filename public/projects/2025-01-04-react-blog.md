## I. The project

A few months ago, I was on the lookout for a template to kickstart my personal
blog. That's when I stumbled upon Chirpy, a beautifully designed Jekyll-based
theme. Its clean aesthetics immediately caught my attention, and I've been
using it ever since for my blog.

Recently, however, I found myself wanting to brush up on my frontend web
development skills. To challenge myself, I decided to recreate the Chirpy theme
using React JS. The result? The very site you're browsing right now!

There are plenty of additional features I plan to implement in the near future,
so stay tuned.

## II. Technical Highlights

- Used `react-markdown` as a parser and processor of markdown files.
- Basic navigation and routing across the site are powered by `react-router-dom`.
- Redux is used to manage global state of the website
- I reused and adapted some SASS files from the original Chirpy repository, customizing them to align with my personal preferences.

## III. Quick Start

> A wise man said this quote

There is `inline code` and code block as this one below:

```python
# Python program to add two numbers
num1 = 5
num2 = 3
sum = num1 + num2
print("Sum:", sum)
```

You can specify a file name for the code:

```python,add.py
# Python program to add two numbers
num1 = 5
num2 = 3
sum = num1 + num2
print("Sum:", sum)
```

The default is a console layout:

```
root@workstation:~$ cat file.txt
Hello World!
```
